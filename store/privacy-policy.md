# Privacy Policy — SimGrid to RaceStand Importer

**Last updated:** 2026-02-05

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It does not use analytics, telemetry, cookies, or tracking of any kind.

## How It Works

The extension reads championship data from TheSimGrid.com pages you visit and formats it for display in a local RaceStand viewer. All processing happens entirely within your browser. No data is sent to any external server.

## Permissions

- **activeTab / tabs** — used to read championship data from the current TheSimGrid page and to open the RaceStand viewer tab.
- **Host permissions (thesimgrid.com)** — required to inject the content script that reads championship standings.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not communicate with any third-party services or APIs.
